# Dictionary:- In Python it is a collection of keys values, used to 
#              to store data values like a map, which, unlike other 
#              data types which hold only single value as an element.

# Dictionary holds "key:value" pair. Key-Value is provided in the dictionary
# to make it more optimized.
